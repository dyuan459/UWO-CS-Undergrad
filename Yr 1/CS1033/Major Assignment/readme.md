# **Major Assignment**
## General overview
This was the major assignment for CS1033: Multimedia and Communications I. The objective was to create a static HTML website without using divs. The website needed to include a self-made banner, a self-created video featuring both hard and soft captions, rollover buttons, and an element of PowerPoint animation. The website could be based on various themes, and I chose to focus on favorite foods.
